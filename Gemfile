# WARNING MESSAGE: [DEPRECATED] Your Gemfile contains multiple primary sources. Using `source` more than once without a block is a security risk, and may result in installing unexpected gems. To resolve this warning, use a block to indicate which gems should come from the secondary source. To upgrade this warning to an error, run `bundle config set disable_multisource true`.

#RESOLUTION more than one source listed causes the above warning: https://mensfeld.pl/2015/03/bundler-warning-this-gemfile-contains-multiple-primary-sources/
